Attribute Information:

For more information, read [Cortez and Morais, 2007]. 
1. X - x-axis spatial coordinate within the Montesinho park map: 1 to 9 
2. Y - y-axis spatial coordinate within the Montesinho park map: 2 to 9 
3. month - month of the year: 'jan' to 'dec' 
4. day - day of the week: 'mon' to 'sun' 
5. FFMC - Fine Fuel Moisture Code index from the FWI system: 18.7 to 96.20 
  "This code is an indicator of the relative ease of ignition and the flammability of fine fuel."
6. DMC - Duff Moisture Code index from the FWI system: 1.1 to 291.3 
  "This code gives an indication of fuel consumption in moderate duff layers and medium-size woody material."
7. DC - Drought Code index from the FWI system: 7.9 to 860.6 
   "This code is a useful indicator of seasonal drought effects on forest fuels and the amount of smoldering in deep duff layers and large logs."
8. ISI - Intial Spatial Index index from the FWI system: 0.0 to 56.10 
  "It combines the effects of wind and the FFMC on rate of spread without the influence of variable quantities of fuel."
9. temp - temperature in Celsius degrees: 2.2 to 33.30 
10. RH - relative humidity in %: 15.0 to 100 
11. wind - wind speed in km/h: 0.40 to 9.40 
12. rain - outside rain in mm/m2 : 0.0 to 6.4 
13. area - the burned area of the forest (in ha): 0.00 to 1090.84 
(this output variable is very skewed towards 0.0, thus it may make 
sense to model with the logarithm transform).
